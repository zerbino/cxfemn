* Core Requirement 4

Thursday October 31st,2013

** Added Project SOAPCoreRequirement4 

Please refer to the core requirement 4,  in "Substitution Principle in an Object-Oriented Framework for Web Services: From Failure to Success", 4.1, p8
	
Here we want to illustrate the fact that "The command generation and the composition of the schema compilation and generation commutes". 

It means that
- EITHER generating a SOAP command from an object,then  generating a schema from it and getting the compilation of it back to an object instance;
- OR making the generation & compilation and then generating a SOAP command of this object
- WILL LEAD to the same result.

You can see an example of it in SOAPCoreRequirement4\src\CoreRequirementTest.java .
